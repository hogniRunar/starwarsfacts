### Hello DarknessInUs, this is your secret santa speaking:

You specifically said that you didn't want stuff that you could buy yourself
and that you wanted something that _I_ would want to give you. After reading your
description and bio (and reddit stalking you) combined with the fact that you
are a programmer who likes javascript (took a small leap here), I decided to
program something for you.

The funny thing is that I am also a computer scientist but I work as an
operations engineer so I don't get to do a lot of programming. I tend to work
more with stuff like bash scripts and maybe some python stuff.

But like you, I have also been trying to increase my programming skills in
various languages. But I find the hardest thing, in regards to trying to become
a better programmer, is finding stuff to program. I find it insanely hard to
think of something to practice on and even after I find something I never seem
to be able to start getting stuff done.

Assuming you might have the some problems I decided to do this:

As we both share love of all things Star Wars I decided to make a small frontend
for the [swapi.co API](http://swapi.co) which would display random facts from
the Star Wars universe. I thought it could be cool to have a screen somewhere in
your living room or somewhere, where you could display this info. I used the
VueJS framework (which I have never used before) in order to make a small SPA.
VueJS is like a lightweight AngularJS from what I can tell.

The catch is that I made it so it works in the very basic sense of the word.
That is, it functions now but it doesn't look pretty and it is poorly optimized.

### So my gift to you:

Practice your JavaScript programming skills by improving upon this very basic
webpage to make it into something very awesome.

In the source code, I have written a couple of TODOs for you to take a look at.

Other ideas on improving the webpage:

- Display the counter for the refresh (currently set to 60 seconds)
- Some information is provided in URLs and then resolved to the names behind
  those URLs. A good idea would be to make those names clickable which would
  fetch the URLs that are behind it. (for ex. if you see Luke's name under a
  specific film, you could click his name and that would fetch his information).
- The CSS needs major work and this could be made to look a lot cooler.
- Get image references for all the things. (there is a work in progress feature
  for the API which addresses this but it could take a while)
- Have a menu on the side for "popular stuff" which would fetch the information
  for that item (could have a list of characters, planets, films etc.).
- General optimization as I am not the strongest JavaScript programmer :)
- Clean up the code
- What eeever you can think of

## This is a gift that I would love to get and I sincerely hope you feel the same way
# Happy Arbitrary day!
